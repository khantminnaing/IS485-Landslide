    "text": "The data inventory in this study comprises two main components: historic landslide data samples and landslide factor variables.\n\nLandslide Inventory\n\nA total of 10,483 instances of translational, rotational shallow landslides, and debris flows were gathered from the Inventory of Landslide Phenomena in Italy (IFFI), which is a national data initiative between the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) [29] and regional and autonomous provinces. Additionally, non-landslide samples provided by the Geomatics and Earth Observation lab (GIS-GEOLab@Politecnico di Milano) were incorporated to enhance the training and testing sets. While acknowledging the potential of crowd-sourced landslide data inventories such as NASA - Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository, the study prioritized proprietary and ground-truth datasets from national repositories to ensure the accuracy of the target outcomes.\n\nLandslide Factors Dataset Overview\n\nCareful consideration and acquisition of appropriate data for various landslide susceptibility factors is of equal significance. To this end, Geoportale della Lombardia has maintained a comprehensive collection of geospatial data tailored for the Lombardy Region. Moreover, the digital lithology compiled by Bucci et al. has furnished an extensive classification of geological formations in Italy at a scale of 1:100 000. A selection and preparation of 15 landslide susceptibility factors have been undertaken for this study. These factors encompass a wide range of geological, topological, meteorological, hydrological, and human-related aspects.\n\nSummary of Landslide Factors used for Landslide Susceptibility Modelling \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nSource (Final Data Type)\nScale\nType\n\n\n\n\nTopographic Factors \n \n \n \n\n\n(1) Elevation \nGeoportale della Lombardia, DEM Derived (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\n(2) Slope Angle \nGeoportale della Lombardia, DEM Derived (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\n(3) Aspect \nGeoportale della Lombardia, DEM Derived (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nCategorial \n\n\n(4) Profile Curvature \nGeoportale della Lombardia, DEM Derived (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\n(5) Plan Curvature \nGeoportale della Lombardia, DEM Derived (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\nGeological Factors \n \n \n \n\n\n(6) Lithology \nBucci et al., 2021 (Raster) \n1:100 000 \nCategorical \n\n\n(7) Distance to Faults \nGeoportale della Lombardia, DEM Derived (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\nMeteorological Factors \n \n \n\n\n\n(8) Average Precipitation \nARPA Lombardia (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\nHydrological Factors \n \n \n \n\n\n(9) Distance to Streams \nGeoportale della Lombardia (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\n(10) Topographic Wetness Index \nGeoportale della Lombardia, DEM Derived (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\n(11) Steam Power Index \nGeoportale della Lombardia, DEM Derived (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\n(12) Sediment Transport Index \nGeoportale della Lombardia, DEM Derived (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\nAnthropogenic Factors \n \n \n\n\n\n(13) Distance to Settlements \nOpenStreetMap (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\n(14) Distance to Road Networks \nGeoportale della Lombardia (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nContinuous \n\n\n(15) Land Use Land Cover \nGeoportale della Lombardia (Raster) \n15 × 15 m  \nCategorial \n\n\n\n\nTopographic Factors\nFive topographic elements identified - elevation, slope angle, aspect, profile curvature, and plan curvature - are extracted from the 5m digital elevation model image. Elevations in landslide occurrence are largely attributed to its correlation with various climatic variables and slope angles have a large control over mass movements. Aspect, or slope direction, is indicative of the moisture content and solar exposure of the slope surface. Curvatures are variations in slope gradients. Profile and planar curvatures are two measures extensively used in landslide modelling, due to their direct impact on mass movement and flow. While profile curvature manages the speed of flow, plan curvature controls the direction of mass movement along a terrain. Curvature maps are classified into three categories: concave, flat, and convex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeological Factors\nThe two geological factors used are lithology and distance to fault. Lithological modifications affect the durability and compactness of soils and rocks and serve as important indicators of potential slope failures. The lithology classification of the study area is ​extracted from the​ 1:100000 Italy ​Geological Map​ provided by Bucci et al. led to 13 lithological classes. They were further categorized into metamorphic, plutonic, sedimentary rock, volcanic and unconsolidated classes. Faults are fractures between blocks of rock, along which displacements and mass movements can occur. Closer to major faults, the fracture density of a plane is greater and this produces more debris while reducing rock strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeteorological Factors\nMeteorological factors refer to the various weather conditions. In context of landslides, weather patterns, particularly precipitation, play a significant role. Heavy and prolonged rainfall can saturate and weak the underlying soils and rocks that form slopes, leading to slope instability and subsequently rainfall-induced landslides. This study uses average precipitation data to model landslide susceptibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrological Factors\nHydrological factors also stimulate landslides. Four relevant hydrological factors explored in this study are distance to streams, ​Topographic Wetness Index (TWI​), ​Stream Power Index (SPI​) and Sediment Transport Index (STI). Proximity to streams gives a direct hydrological input that saturates soil and increases pore water pressures weakening slopes. TWI is a measure of topographic control on hydrological processes and soil moisture distribution [50] and areas with higher TWI values indicate greater concentration of hydrological flow and soil saturation. Increased soil moisture reduces shear strength and causes slope failures. SPI encapsulates hydrological​ processes in natural terrains and quantifies their erosive power based on flow accumulation and slope. Higher SPI is indicative of greater fluvial erosive power and potential slope undercutting. These hydrological factors capture important hydrological processes affecting slope stability: direct hydrological loading from proximity to streams; distributed soil patterns from TWI; and fluvial erosion power from SPI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthropogenic Factors\nAnthropogenic factors pertain to human-induced changes that influence the predisposing characteristics of slopes and soils. This study focuses on distance to settlements, distance to road networks and ​land use land cover. The​ construction of road networks has a strong correlation with landslide susceptibility as it cuts slopes that alter natural topography and degrade slope stability. Manmade structures can exert substantial loads on the terrain and displace surfaces. Land cover is another crucial indicator of human alteration of vegetation areas. Previous research has also underlined the importance of landslide susceptibility assessment."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nLandslides, the failure and mass movement of slopes, have increased tenfold over the past five decades. Driven by tectonic, climatic, and human activities, they pose significant threats to infrastructure and urban communities, causing costly damage and displacement. While engineering solutions like concrete surfacing and terracing mitigate risks on gradual slopes, steeper terrains require more complex and expensive interventions. Implementing landslide susceptibility maps can aid urban planning by prioritizing high-risk areas, guiding preventive measures, and assessing site suitability for new developments.\nAs a result, landslide susceptibility modeling has emerged as a timely and crucial area of research. In this field, geoscientists and researchers strive to model landslide occurrences as a dynamic function of various predisposing and conditioning factors. Several qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches have been explored and proposed to establish the causal link between landslide factors and landslide susceptibility. Methodologically, many studies have explored different statistical and machine learning methods. Despite their usefulness, these methods often fail to explicitly consider the impact of spatial non-stationarity and spatial autocorrelation when geographically referenced data are used, thereby limiting their interpretability and practice applicability.\nIn this project, presented by Khant Min Naing and Victoria Grace Ann from Singapore Management University, we explore the potential of integrating spatial properties into generalised statistical and machine learning based landslide models. Using Valtellina Valley in Italy as a case study, this study developed and trained three spatial landslide models, Geographically Weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR), Moran’s Eigenvector Random Forest (MERF) and Geographically Weighted Random Forest (GWRF) and proposes an Integrated Dual Geographical Random Forest Framework (Dual GRF) leveraging on MERF and GWRF. The findings demonstrate that spatial models outperform global baseline models and result in more spatially-adaptive landslide risk predictions and interpretations.\n\nAcademic Recognition\n\nThis project has achieved significant academic recognition, resulting in two peer-reviewed publications. Additionally, the findings have been presented at two prestigious academic conferences, renowned within the fields of computational science and geospatial information systems. These accomplishments highlight the project’s contribution to advancing knowledge and its impact on the academic community.\n\nConference Presentations\n\n\n\n\n\n24th International Conference on Computational Science and its Applications\nJuly 1 - 4, 2024\nHanoi, Vietnam\n\n\n\n12th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Analytics for Big Geospatial Data (BigSpatial 2024)\nOctober 29 - November 1, 2024\nAtlanta, GA, USA\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nKhant Min Naing, Victoria Grace Ann and Tin Seong Kam. 2024.

These models can be generally categorized into four categories: expert-based, physically-based, statistical and machine learning-based.\n\nPhysically-based models are of the highest utility in theory, but such models often face challenges and uncertainties for real-world application due to the limited availability of spatially differentiated geotechnical data.\nCompared to physically-based models, expert-based models are less data-intensive as they are developed with the expert knowledge of local interactions between landslide occurrences and its controlling factors. Due to its qualitative nature, expert-based models often lack objectivity and reproducibility, and are not commonly used in scientific research.\nStatistical landslide susceptibility modelling seeks to estimate the spatial likelihood or relative spatial probability of spatial units to coincide with future landslide occurrence. These models have been widely adopted for practical application due to their relatively lower input data demand (than physically based models) and quantitative modelling output (which expert-based models lack).\nMachine learning models have emerged as promising alternatives to statistical models due to their flexibility and high predictive accuracy. They are favored for their ability to solve nonlinear problems, improve performance across various classifiers, and capture complex relationships between variables.\n\nNevertheless, previous research has demonstrated that each model type has its unique strengths and limitations, and choosing an appropriate model depends largely on various factors, such as interpretability, generalisability, and the specific research objectives.\n\n\n\nMany models using large spatial datasets for landslide risk prediction often overlook spatial nonstationarity. This occurs when global models assume uniformity in variable relationships across space, ignoring local variations. Failing to address spatial nonstationarity limits a model’s ability to capture spatial autocorrelation, where nearby values are more similar than those farther apart. Consequently, such models lack adaptability to inherent spatial properties, potentially affecting their accuracy and applicability in complex environments.\nIn 1996, Fotheringham, Charlton, and Brunson highlighted the impact of spatial nonstationarity on regression parameter estimates in geospatial datasets. They argued that relying on a global estimate of relationships can obscure important geographical variations within the data. Models not calibrated to underlying spatial properties often produce less realistic inferences and overlook underlying spatial structures. This issue, known as spatial nonstationarity, arises when a global model cannot accurately represent the relationships between variables due to local spatial variations, violating the assumption that these relationships remain constant across space.\n\n\n\nOur study focuses on comparing the performance and applications of statistical and machine learning models in landslide susceptibility assessment. In particular, our study compares global models and their spatial derivatives in incorporating spatial relationships into landslide susceptibility modeling, guided by two key questions.\n\n\n\nWhat are the (i) landform properties and (ii) human-environment interaction factors affecting landslide susceptibility? Is landslide susceptibility independent geospatially?\nIs landslide susceptibility independent geospatially?\nDoes the contribution landslide factors vary across the study area?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can spatial relationships and local dependencies be accounted in generalised statistical and machine learning models?\nDo spatially-calibrated models perform better predictions than generalised baseline models?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, relationships between variables may be nonstationary. However, traditional regression models assume that predictors and outcome variables are spatially homogeneous, or stationary.\nOrdinary least squares (OLS) linear regression is a standard global modelling technique that cannot detect nonstationarity, and thus using it may obscure regional variation in the relationships between predictors and the outcome variable.Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a local regression framework proposed by Fotheringham, Charlton and Brunson. This model is suited for spatial analysis as it extends traditional and global regression frameworks such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) by integrating spatial weights and generating local-level model statistics.\n\n\n\nBuilding upon the concept of Moran’s Eigenvector Maps (MEMs), Benito introduced a spatial RF model incorporating spatial dependency. This model, termed Moran’s Eigenvector Random Forest (MERF) in this study, first generates MEMs from a weight matrix. MEMs have two important properties. First, they are orthogonal unit vectors that maximize Moran’s I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation. Second, their associated eigenvalues are equal to the Moran’s I coefficients, describing the strength of local spatial structures. MERF hence uses MEMs as variables of spatial predictors when fitting a standard, non-spatial RF model. Directly incorporating these spatial predictors during model training enables MERF to integrate underlying spatial dependence in the data that a standard, nonspatial global RF would otherwise ignore. Chiefly, the MERF model allows RF to learn patterns related to spatial autocorrelation that would improve its ability to model spatially structured phenomena like landslides.\n\n\n\nProposed by Georganos and Kalogirou, GWRF is the spatial disaggregation of the classic RF model into an ensemble of local models. This formulation is based on the principles of the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) framework wherein a global process is decomposed into several local submodels. This methodology implies that spatial interactions are more effectively captured through an ensemble of local models rather than incorporating numerous spatial predictors into a single global model, as seen in the MERF approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nCascini, L.: Applicability of landslide susceptibility and hazard zoning at different scales.

    "text": "Study Area Selection\n\nValtellina Valley, Lombardy Region, Italy\n\nValtellina Valley, located in the Central Alps of Northern Italy, is chosen as the study area. The valley extends between 515,000 metres and 620,000 metres in easting (9.24°E to 10.63°E in longitude), and between 5,050,000 metres and 5,170,000 metres in northing (46.00°N to 46.64°N in latitude) and covers about 3308 square kilometres. The average mountain elevation there ranges from 2,500 to 3,000 meters with the bottom of the valley lying about 1000 to 1100 metres above sea level. The valley is cut by the Adda River flowing from North to South and characterized by a superimposed fluvial morphology and high steep slopes, akin to typical alpine glacial valleys [1]. The geomorphological features of the valley exhibit a pronounced contrast between its opposing slopes. The East–West orientation of the valley is also attributed to the geologic fault called the Periadriatic Seam, which imposes tectonic lineament upon the valley [2].\nValtellina valley has experienced significant damage and destruction over the century from landslides such as the historic Valpola landslide and floods. The landslides are mostly attributed to geological instability arising from tectonic and post-glacial conditions [3], soil type, soil moisture and slope acclivity which activate mass movements [4]. Additionally, Valtellina’s wine agriculture like Chiavennasca grapes, popular ski and holiday towns such as Sondrio, Livigno, Aprica, Bormio and Morbegno are highly sort after. The resulting surge in economic activities and overdevelopment of human settlements have extensively remodified the landform’s geomorphology which exacerbate Valtellina’s landslide susceptibility [2-3]. Overall, the region’s steep slopes, heavy rainfall, geological instability and man-made modifications to the natural landscape/ make it an interesting study area for this study.\n\nReferences\n\n\nAlexander, D.: Valtellina landslide and flood emergency, Northern Italy, 1987.
