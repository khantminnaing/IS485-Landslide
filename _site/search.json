    "text": "Study Area Selection\n\nValtellina Valley, Lombardy Region, Italy\nValtellina or the Valtelline is a valley in the Lombardy region of northern Italy. The most important comune of the valley is Sondrio; the others major centers are Aprica, Morbegno, Tirano, Chiavenna, Bormio and Livigno.\nNestled between Switzerland and the Lombard plain, the valley’s geographical setting plays a crucial role in its susceptibility to landslides, making it an ideal case study for understanding and mitigating these complex natural hazards.\nGeographic Features:\n\nAlpine Setting: Situated within the collision zone of the European and African plates, the Valtellina Valley experiences ongoing tectonic activity, leading to steep slopes, unstable rock formations, and frequent seismic tremors.\nGlacial Legacy: Past glacial activity sculpted the valley’s topography, resulting in U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, and over-steepened slopes, all contributing to potential landslide initiation zones.\nHydrological Regimen: The Adda River, fed by abundant alpine meltwater and subject to intense seasonal precipitation, carves into the valley floor, further weakening slopes and contributing to soil saturation, a key trigger for landslides.\nDensely Populated: Despite its rugged terrain, the Valtellina Valley boasts a thriving population, with numerous villages and towns nestled along its slopes and valley floor. This proximity to potential landslides heightens the vulnerability of people and infrastructure."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nLandslides are a major natural hazard that can have a devastating impact on cities and communities all around the world. Over the past five decades, disasters caused by landslides have become ten times more frequent (Cendrero et al., 2020). Worldwide, landslides cause billions of dollars in infrastructural damage and thousands of deaths every year. On average, about 3,500 people per year are killed due to landslide events all around the world (Froude & Petley, 2018). In addition to casualties, landslides also impose long-term economic and social impacts, including property damage, disruption of access to essential services and supplies, and eventually displacement of people. Moreover, the aftermath of landslides often requires significant resources and time for recovery and reconstruction efforts, further straining already limited resources in affected areas.\nWith increased urbanisation and magnitude of landslides, landslide susceptibility modelling is an emerging research area of both importance and urgency. This gives rise from the eternal disaster threats of landslides across the world.\nSeveral approaches have been explored for landslide susceptibility zoning in the scientific literature. However, there are still many challenges in terms of developing accurate and reliable models. A pertinent challenge is the lack of comprehensive and high-quality landslide inventories which hinders the accurate assessment of the factors contributing to landslide susceptibility. Additionally, the complex nature of landslides makes it difficult to establish a universally applicable model.\nThus, this project aims to research and develop a reproducible methodology framework for building and calibrating landslide susceptibility zoning models in order to advance the current scientific knowledge base and research efforts."

If these highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model by mistake, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nCorrelation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. In this section, the corrplot package will be used to display the correlation matrix of the independent variables in condo_resale data frame.\n\ncorrplot(cor(train_grids[, 6:31]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         col=colorRampPalette(c(\"#50a8b4\",\"#e4c838\",\"#be804f\"))(10),\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5,tl.col = \"black\", number.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\n\n\ncorrplot(cor(train_grids[,6:31]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         col=colorRampPalette(c(\"#50a8b4\",\"#ffffdd\",\"#be804f\"))(10),\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5,tl.col = \"black\", number.cex = 0.5, method = \"ellipse\", type = \"upper\")\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and patter in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, AOE order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method suggested by Michael Friendly.\n\n\n3.2 Correlation Matrix tUsing ggstats\n\nset.seed(123)\n## producing the correlation matrix\nggcorrmat(\n  data = train_grids[, 6:31],  \n          matrix.type = \"upper\",\n  type = \"parametric\",\n  tr = 0.2,\n  partial = FALSE,\n  k = 2L,\n  sig.level = 0.05,\n  conf.level = 0.95,\n  bf.prior = 0.707,\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(\n     tl.cex = 10,\n     pch.cex = 5,\n     lab_size = 3\n  )) + ## modification outside `{ggstatsplot}` using `{ggplot2}` functions\n  ggplot2::theme(\n    axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(\n      margin = ggplot2::margin(t = 0.15, r = 0.15, b = 0.15, l = 0.15, unit = \"cm\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Test for Spatial Autocorrelation\nFirst, we will import the dataset.\n\ntrain_point &lt;- read_sf(dsn = \"./data/vector\", layer = \"train_point\") %&gt;% st_transform(crs = 32632)\n\ntrain_point\n\nSimple feature collection with 50563 features and 31 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 519097.5 ymin: 5095541 xmax: 624487.5 ymax: 5164991\nProjected CRS: WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N\n# A tibble: 50,563 × 32\n   Train_ID Grid_ID       X        Y Landslide Elevation Slope_Angl Aspect_Nor\n *    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1    29037 8236207 584767. 5160491.         1     2621        11.1          0\n 2    28534 8092089 585232. 5159711.         0     2737.       90.0          0\n 3    29021 8232815 584782. 5160866.         0     2721        90.0          0\n 4    27434 7755202 586222. 5160581.         1     2237        28.5          0\n 5    27468 7762804 586192. 5160626.         1     2200        27.7          1\n 6    27469 7762811 586192. 5160521.         1     2271        35.5          0\n 7    27482 7766683 586177. 5160776.         1     2119.       31.9          0\n 8    27553 7792961 586117. 5160071.         1     2607        47.5          0\n 9    27567 7796978 586102. 5161031.         1     2188.       27.6          0\n10    27568 7797002 586102. 5161151.         1     2296        32.7          0\n# ℹ 50,553 more rows\n# ℹ 24 more variables: Aspect_N_1 &lt;int&gt;, Aspect_Eas &lt;int&gt;, Aspect_Sou &lt;int&gt;,\n#   Aspect_S_1 &lt;int&gt;, Aspect_S_2 &lt;int&gt;, Aspect_Wes &lt;int&gt;, Aspect_N_2 &lt;int&gt;,\n#   Profile_Cu &lt;dbl&gt;, Plan_Curva &lt;dbl&gt;, Lithology_ &lt;int&gt;, Litholog_1 &lt;int&gt;,\n#   Litholog_2 &lt;int&gt;, Litholog_3 &lt;int&gt;, Litholog_4 &lt;int&gt;, Proximity_ &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Proximit_1 &lt;dbl&gt;, Proximit_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, Proximit_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, Landuse_No &lt;int&gt;,\n#   Landuse_Ve &lt;int&gt;, Landuse_Wa &lt;int&gt;, Precipitat &lt;dbl&gt;, TWI &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nIn order to perform spatial autocorrelation test, we need to convert train_point from sf data frame into a SpatialPointsDataFrame.\n\ntrain_point.sp &lt;- as_Spatial(train_point)\n\n\n\n3.4 Simple Logistic Regression\nWe will fit a logistic regression model in order to predict the probability of a customer defaulting based on the average balance carried by the customer.

The syntax of the glm function is similar to that of lm, except that we must pass the argument family = binomial in order to tell R to run a logistic regression rather than some other type of generalized linear model.\n\nlandslide.lr &lt;- glm(Landslide ~ Elevation + Slope_Angle + Aspect_North + Aspect_NorthEast + Aspect_East+Aspect_SouthEast+Aspect_South + Aspect_SouthWest +Aspect_West + Aspect_NorthWest + Profile_Curvature +Plan_Curvature + Lithology_Metamorphic+Lithology_Sedimentary + Lithology_Volcanic+Lithology_Plutonic+Lithology_Unconsolidated + Proximity_Settlement+Proximity_Stream+Proximity_Road+Proximity_Fault+Landuse_Nonvegetation+Landuse_Vegetation+Landuse_Waterbody+Precipitation+TWI, family = \"binomial\", data = train_grids)\n\n\nsummary(landslide.lr)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Landslide ~ Elevation + Slope_Angle + Aspect_North + \n    Aspect_NorthEast + Aspect_East + Aspect_SouthEast + Aspect_South + \n    Aspect_SouthWest + Aspect_West + Aspect_NorthWest + Profile_Curvature + \n    Plan_Curvature + Lithology_Metamorphic + Lithology_Sedimentary + \n    Lithology_Volcanic + Lithology_Plutonic + Lithology_Unconsolidated + \n    Proximity_Settlement + Proximity_Stream + Proximity_Road + \n    Proximity_Fault + Landuse_Nonvegetation + Landuse_Vegetation + \n    Landuse_Waterbody + Precipitation + TWI, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = train_grids)\n\nCoefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities)\n                           Estimate Std.

If these highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model by mistake, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nCorrelation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. In this section, the corrplot package will be used to display the correlation matrix of the independent variables in condo_resale data frame.\n\ncorrplot(cor(train_grids_v2[, 6:33]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         col=colorRampPalette(c(\"#50a8b4\",\"#e4c838\",\"#be804f\"))(10),\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5,tl.col = \"black\", number.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\n\n\ncorrplot(cor(train_grids_v2[,6:33]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         col=colorRampPalette(c(\"#50a8b4\",\"#ffffdd\",\"#be804f\"))(10),\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5,tl.col = \"black\", number.cex = 0.5, method = \"ellipse\", type = \"upper\")\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and patter in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, AOE order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method suggested by Michael Friendly.\n\n\n4.2 Correlation Matrix Using ggstats\n\nset.seed(123)\n## producing the correlation matrix\nggcorrmat(\n  data = train_grids_v2[, 6:33],  \n          matrix.type = \"upper\",\n  type = \"parametric\",\n  tr = 0.2,\n  partial = FALSE,\n  k = 2L,\n  sig.level = 0.05,\n  conf.level = 0.95,\n  bf.prior = 0.707,\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(\n     tl.cex = 10,\n     pch.cex = 5,\n     lab_size = 3\n  )) + ## modification outside `{ggstatsplot}` using `{ggplot2}` functions\n  ggplot2::theme(\n    axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(\n      margin = ggplot2::margin(t = 0.15, r = 0.15, b = 0.15, l = 0.15, unit = \"cm\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Simple Logistic Regression\nWe will fit a logistic regression model in order to predict the probability of a customer defaulting based on the average balance carried by the customer. The glm function fits generalized linear models, a class of models that includes logistic regression. The syntax of the glm function is similar to that of lm, except that we must pass the argument family = binomial in order to tell R to run a logistic regression rather than some other type of generalized linear model.\n\nlandslide.lr_2 &lt;- glm(Landslide ~ Elevation + Slope_Angle + Aspect_North + Aspect_NorthEast + Aspect_East+Aspect_SouthEast+Aspect_South + Aspect_SouthWest +Aspect_West + Aspect_NorthWest + Profile_Curvature +Plan_Curvature + Lithology_Metamorphic+Lithology_Sedimentary + Lithology_Volcanic+Lithology_Plutonic+Lithology_Unconsolidated + Proximity_Settlement+Proximity_Stream+Proximity_Road+Proximity_Fault+Landuse_Nonvegetation+Landuse_Vegetation+Precipitation+TWI+SPI+STI, family = \"binomial\", data = train_grids_v2)\n\n\nsummary(landslide.lr_2)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Landslide ~ Elevation + Slope_Angle + Aspect_North + \n    Aspect_NorthEast + Aspect_East + Aspect_SouthEast + Aspect_South + \n    Aspect_SouthWest + Aspect_West + Aspect_NorthWest + Profile_Curvature + \n    Plan_Curvature + Lithology_Metamorphic + Lithology_Sedimentary + \n    Lithology_Volcanic + Lithology_Plutonic + Lithology_Unconsolidated + \n    Proximity_Settlement + Proximity_Stream + Proximity_Road + \n    Proximity_Fault + Landuse_Nonvegetation + Landuse_Vegetation + \n    Precipitation + TWI + SPI + STI, family = \"binomial\", data = train_grids_v2)\n\nCoefficients:\n                           Estimate Std.
