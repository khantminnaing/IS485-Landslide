    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\n\nLandslides refer to the geomorphic phenomenon of slope failure and mass movement in mountainous regions due to eroding and depositing sediment. In the span of the last five decades, the frequency of landslide events has increased tenfold [1]. Landslides are complex geomorphic phenomena and are driven by tectonic, climatic and/or human activities [2]. Landslides pose a frequent threat to critical infrastructure and urban communities worldwide, causing increasingly costly damage and massive displacement that hampers urban development [3-6].\nExtensive engineering prevention works such as concrete surfacing, terracing [7] and slope modification [8] are typical, successful landslide risk mitigations for more gradually sloped areas. However, implementing these works on steeper terrains incurs greater costs due to the complexity of these modifications. Slope geometry alterations, complex drainage systems installations, and reinforcing internal structures for a single high-risk site easily cost millions [8]. With the implementation of landslide susceptibility maps and assessments, tiering areas according to their instability levels could supplement in urban planning decisions and the prioritization of the highest-risk areas which kickstart the formulation of preventive measures and site suitability assessments for new developments [9].\nIn this study, global and local versions of statistical and machine learning techniques explore the explanatory factors influencing landslide susceptibility and the prediction of susceptibility areas within our study area. Two statistical models – Logistic Regression (LR) and Geographically Weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR) models and two machine learning models – Random Forest (RF) and Geographically Weighted Random Forest (GWRF) are fitted and developed in this study. Landslide occurrences are closely related to the characteristics of the environment and the explanatory variables of landslides are unlikely to have an equal and constant contribution to their occurrences [10] over the entire study area. When working with spatial datasets, conventional modelling approaches such as LR and RF attempt to treat observations as independent values and usually produce parameter estimates and predictions which do not consider spatial aspects such as spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity. Using models that are not calibrated to model underlying spatial structures is likely to produce results with less ground-realistic inferences [11] and overlook local variations or structures. This study aims to draw a comparative case study between these global models and their spatial and local derivate models, analysing how global models can be calibrated into local derivates to account for spatial relationship as well as to improve the model outcomes.\n\nReferences\n\n\nCendrero, A., Forte, L.M., Remondo, J., Cuesta‐Albertos, J.A.: Anthropocene Geomorphic Change. climate or human activities?

    "text": "Study Area Selection\n\nValtellina Valley, Lombardy Region, Italy\n\nValtellina Valley, located in the Central Alps of Northern Italy, is chosen as the study area. The valley extends between 515,000 metres and 620,000 metres in easting (9.24°E to 10.63°E in longitude), and between 5,050,000 metres and 5,170,000 metres in northing (46.00°N to 46.64°N in latitude) and covers about 3308 square kilometres. The average mountain elevation there ranges from 2,500 to 3,000 meters with the bottom of the valley lying about 1000 to 1100 metres above sea level. The valley is cut by the Adda River flowing from North to South and characterized by a superimposed fluvial morphology and high steep slopes, akin to typical alpine glacial valleys [1]. The geomorphological features of the valley exhibit a pronounced contrast between its opposing slopes. The East–West orientation of the valley is also attributed to the geologic fault called the Periadriatic Seam, which imposes tectonic lineament upon the valley [2].\nValtellina valley has experienced significant damage and destruction over the century from landslides such as the historic Valpola landslide and floods. The landslides are mostly attributed to geological instability arising from tectonic and post-glacial conditions [3], soil type, soil moisture and slope acclivity which activate mass movements [4]. Additionally, Valtellina’s wine agriculture like Chiavennasca grapes, popular ski and holiday towns such as Sondrio, Livigno, Aprica, Bormio and Morbegno are highly sort after. The resulting surge in economic activities and overdevelopment of human settlements have extensively remodified the landform’s geomorphology which exacerbate Valtellina’s landslide susceptibility [2-3]. Overall, the region’s steep slopes, heavy rainfall, geological instability and man-made modifications to the natural landscape/ make it an interesting study area for this study.\n\nReferences\n\n\nAlexander, D.: Valtellina landslide and flood emergency, Northern Italy, 1987.

    "text": "4.2 Correlation Matrix\nBefore building a logistic regression model, it's important to ensure that the independent variables used are not highly correlated with each other. If highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model, the quality of the model will be compromised.\nPearson's correlation is a commonly used correlation coefficient to calculate and visualize the relationships between the independent variables. It measures the linear relationship between the two variables and takes values between -1 and 1; -1 means a total negative linear correlation, 0 means no correlation, and 1 means a total positive correlation. Pearson's correlation can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}}{\\sqrt{\\sum{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}}\n\\]\nWe use ggcorrmat to create the correlation matrix.

The colors range from green (positive correlation) through white (no correlation) to orange (negative correlation). An \"X\" mark is placed on cells where the correlation is not statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05 after adjustment for multiple comparisons using Holm's method. This helps in distinguishing meaningful relationships from random associations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nThe maximum correlation coefficient area is observed at 0.55 for pair between elevation and distance to settlement and at 0.49 for pair between elevation and distance to road as well as SPI and STI. Modern civilisation is built on lower elevations and accounts for the moderate coefficients. Other factors exhibit a range of low to moderate correlations. Overall, no factors among those selected for this study exhibit high positive correlation."

Specifically, deviance is a measure of the discrepancy between the data and the model's predictions. The null deviance shows how well the response variable is predicted by a model that includes only the intercept (no predictors). The model's deviance shows how well the response variable is predicted by the model.\nIn mathematical terms, the percentage of deviance explained is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of Deviance Explained} = \\left(1 - \\frac{D_{\\text{model}}}{D_{\\text{null}}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nBelow is the code chunk used to calculate the percentage of deviance using the following steps\n\nCalculate the total deviance, which is the null deviance.\nSubtract the model's deviance from the null deviance. This gives the amount of deviance explained by the model.\nDivide the explained deviance by the null deviance and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n\npd &lt;- 100*with(summary(landslide.lr), 1 - deviance/null.deviance)\npd\n\n[1] 50.89114\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Computing Confidence Intervals\nWe calculate the confidence intervals for the coefficients of the variables in our model.

Validation is a crucial part of the modeling process because it helps us understand how well our model performs on unseen data.\nWe use the blr_confusion_matrix function from the blr package in R to create a confusion matrix for our model. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of data for which the true values are known.\nThe cutoff argument in the blr_confusion_matrix function is used to decide the threshold for classifying a probability into a binary outcome. In this case, we set the cutoff to 0.5, which means that if the predicted probability is greater than or equal to 0.5, the outcome is classified as 1 (landslide), otherwise it is classified as 0 (no landslide).\n\ncm &lt;- blr_confusion_matrix(landslide.lr, cutoff = 0.5)\ncm\n\nConfusion Matrix and Statistics \n\n          Reference\nPrediction     0     1\n         0  6548  1292\n         1  2235 40488\n\n                Accuracy : 0.9302 \n     No Information Rate : 0.1737 \n\n                   Kappa : 0.7462 \n\nMcNemars's Test P-Value  : 0.0000 \n\n             Sensitivity : 0.9691 \n             Specificity : 0.7455 \n          Pos Pred Value : 0.9477 \n          Neg Pred Value : 0.8352 \n              Prevalence : 0.8263 \n          Detection Rate : 0.8007 \n    Detection Prevalence : 0.8449 \n       Balanced Accuracy : 0.8573 \n               Precision : 0.9477 \n                  Recall : 0.9691 \n\n        'Positive' Class : 1\n\n\nThe output cm is the confusion matrix for our logistic regression model.

    "text": "5.2 Curse of Multicollinearity\nRegression models are sensitive to multicollinearity. Multicollinearity arises when two or more explanatory variables in a regression model display moderate or high correlation among each other. The presence of multicollinearity makes it difficult to assess the individual importance and significance of a predictor. Subsequently, variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance (TOL) values are calculated to further evaluate landslide variables. VIF is a statistical measure used in regression analysis to observe the increase in variance of the regression coefficient estimates due to multicollinearity. Mathematically, VIF can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nVIF = \\frac{1}{1 - R_j^2} = \\frac{1}{TOL}\n\\]\n\n5.2.1 Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)\nWe use the multicollinearity function from the performance package to calculate the VIF.\n\nvif &lt;- multicollinearity(landslide.lr)\nvif\n\n# Check for Multicollinearity\n\nLow Correlation\n\n                 Term  VIF   VIF 95% CI Increased SE Tolerance Tolerance 95% CI\n            Elevation 2.36 [2.33, 2.40]         1.54      0.42     [0.42, 0.43]\n          Slope_Angle 1.69 [1.67, 1.71]         1.30      0.59     [0.58, 0.60]\n         Aspect_North 1.50 [1.48, 1.52]         1.22      0.67     [0.66, 0.68]\n     Aspect_NorthEast 1.91 [1.88, 1.93]         1.38      0.52     [0.52, 0.53]\n          Aspect_East 1.95 [1.93, 1.98]         1.40      0.51     [0.51, 0.52]\n     Aspect_SouthEast 2.09 [2.07, 2.12]         1.45      0.48     [0.47, 0.48]\n         Aspect_South 2.15 [2.12, 2.17]         1.46      0.47     [0.46, 0.47]\n     Aspect_SouthWest 2.03 [2.00, 2.05]         1.42      0.49     [0.49, 0.50]\n          Aspect_West 1.93 [1.90, 1.95]         1.39      0.52     [0.51, 0.53]\n    Profile_Curvature 1.42 [1.41, 1.44]         1.19      0.70     [0.70, 0.71]\n       Plan_Curvature 1.49 [1.47, 1.51]         1.22      0.67     [0.66, 0.68]\n   Lithology_Plutonic 1.91 [1.89, 1.94]         1.38      0.52     [0.52, 0.53]\n Proximity_Settlement 1.79 [1.77, 1.81]         1.34      0.56     [0.55, 0.57]\n     Proximity_Stream 1.29 [1.28, 1.31]         1.14      0.77     [0.76, 0.78]\n       Proximity_Road 1.82 [1.80, 1.84]         1.35      0.55     [0.54, 0.56]\n      Proximity_Fault 1.06 [1.05, 1.07]         1.03      0.94     [0.94, 0.95]\n   Landuse_Vegetation 1.39 [1.37, 1.40]         1.18      0.72     [0.71, 0.73]\n        Precipitation 1.30 [1.28, 1.31]         1.14      0.77     [0.76, 0.78]\n                  TWI 2.20 [2.17, 2.23]         1.48      0.45     [0.45, 0.46]\n                  SPI 1.31 [1.29, 1.32]         1.14      0.76     [0.76, 0.77]\n                  STI 1.31 [1.29, 1.32]         1.14      0.76     [0.76, 0.77]\n\nModerate Correlation\n\n                     Term  VIF   VIF 95% CI Increased SE Tolerance\n    Lithology_Metamorphic 7.44 [7.32, 7.57]         2.73      0.13\n    Lithology_Sedimentary 5.13 [5.05, 5.21]         2.27      0.19\n Lithology_Unconsolidated 7.69 [7.56, 7.81]         2.77      0.13\n Tolerance 95% CI\n     [0.13, 0.14]\n     [0.19, 0.20]\n     [0.13, 0.13]\n\n\n\nplot(vif)\n\nVariable `Component` is not in your data frame :/\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are currently no established criteria for identifying the extent of variance inflation factors that result in poorly estimated coefficients.

    "text": "5.3 Stepwise Selection\nIn the initial model, all the independent variables are included. However, including too many variables in a model can lead to overfitting. Overfitting is a modeling error that occurs when a function is too closely aligned to a limited set of data points. An overfitted model may result in an algorithm that is excessively complex, such as one involving a function that has too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfitted will generally have poor predictive performance, as it can exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.\nThe goal of this step is to create a more parsimonious model, which means we aim to include a limited number of independent variables (between 5 and 15) that are all statistically significant, without sacrificing too much on the model's performance.\nTo achieve this, we employ a stepwise variable selection procedure. Stepwise selection is a method of fitting regression models in which the choice of predictive variables is carried out by an automatic procedure. In each step, a variable is considered for addition to or subtraction from the set of explanatory variables based on some prespecified criterion.\nWe use the blr_step_aic_both() function from the blr package in R for this purpose. This function performs both forward and backward stepwise variable selection based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The AIC is a measure of the relative quality of a statistical model for a given set of data. It provides a means for model selection by comparing different models and choosing the one that minimizes the information loss.\n\nstepwise_1 &lt;- blr_step_aic_both(landslide.lr)\n\nWe then load the results of the stepwise selection process to see which variables were selected.\n\nstepwise1\n\n\n                             Stepwise Summary                             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVariable                  Method        AIC          BIC       Deviance  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSlope_Angle              addition    27757.416    27775.078    27753.416 \nProfile_Curvature        addition    25065.141    25091.634    25059.141 \nPlan_Curvature           addition    24303.970    24339.294    24295.970 \nLanduse_Vegetation       addition    23891.260    23935.415    23881.260 \nLithology_Plutonic       addition    23677.727    23730.713    23665.727 \nPrecipitation            addition    23539.203    23601.020    23525.203 \nProximity_Fault          addition    23430.433    23501.081    23414.433 \nTWI                      addition    23337.014    23416.493    23319.014 \nLithology_Sedimentary    addition    23278.363    23366.672    23258.363 \nLithology_Metamorphic    addition    23256.786    23353.927    23234.786 \nProximity_Stream         addition    23245.816    23351.788    23221.816 \nAspect_SouthEast         addition    23237.365    23352.167    23211.365 \nProximity_Road           addition    23231.794    23355.428    23203.794 \nAspect_South             addition    23226.738    23359.203    23196.738 \nAspect_NorthEast         addition    23220.038    23361.333    23188.038 \nAspect_East              addition    23216.825    23366.952    23182.825 \nProximity_Settlement     addition    23214.504    23373.462    23178.504 \nSPI                      addition    23213.794    23381.582    23175.794 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\n17 explanatory variables have been selected in this stepwise selection process.

    "section": "5.7 Stratified Slope Sampling",
    "text": "5.7 Stratified Slope Sampling\nOur data points are located in various places with varying slope angles. Since our initial IV analysis flags out the over-dominance of Slope_Angle over our model results, we first visualize the distribution of slope angles using a histogram. This will help us detect any unbalanced or irregular distribution patterns that could bias our model.\n\n5.7.1 Plotting Distribution of Slope Angles in Landslide and Non-Landslide Samples\nWe start by plotting the distribution of Slope_Angle in landslide samples.\n\nls_data &lt;- train_grids_v4[train_grids_v4$Landslide==1,]\n\nggplot(data=ls_data, aes(x= `Slope_Angle`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=100, color=\"black\", fill=\"#e9531e\") +\n  labs(title=\"Distribution of slope values in landslide samples\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 20, color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nNext, we plot the distribution of Slope_Angle in non-landslide samples.\n\nnon_ls_data &lt;- train_grids_v4[train_grids_v4$Landslide==0,]\n\nggplot(data=non_ls_data, aes(x= `Slope_Angle`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=100, color=\"black\", fill=\"#e9531e\") +\n  labs(title=\"Distribution of slope values in non-landslide samples\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 20, color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\nThe majority of landslide samples have slope angles larger than 20°. In contrast, the majority of non-landslide samples have slope angles less than 20°. As such, the current model predicts any instances with a slope angle greater than 20° to be a landslide. This observation suggests that the Slope_Angle variable might be a strong predictor of landslides.\n\n\n\n5.7.2 Implementing Stratified Slope Sampling\nTo address the data bias with the evidence of quasi-separation, we use a 20° cut-off based on the observation above. Quasi-separation is a situation in logistic regression where the outcome variable separates a predictor variable completely, leading to overfitting. By implementing stratified slope sampling, we aim to create a more balanced dataset that can lead to a more robust model.\nBelow is the code chunk for implementing stratified slope sampling. Here, we create two new datasets: ls_data_20 and non_ls_data_20. These datasets contain landslide and non-landslide samples, respectively, with a slope angle of 20° or less.\n\nls_data_20 &lt;- train_grids_v4[train_grids_v4$Landslide==1 & train_grids_v4$Slope_Angle &lt;= 20,]\nnon_ls_data_20 &lt;- train_grids_v4[train_grids_v4$Landslide==0 & train_grids_v4$Slope_Angle &lt;= 20,]\n\n\n\n5.7.3 Plotting Distribution of Slope Angles in Slope-Stratified Landslide and Non-Landslide Samples\nWe then plot the new distribution of slope in landslide samples.\n\nggplot(data=ls_data_20, aes(x= `Slope_Angle`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=40, color=\"black\", fill=\"#e9531e\") +\n  labs(title=\"Distribution of slope values in landslide samples (15° slope cut-off)\")\n\n\n\n\nWe also plot the new distribution of slope in non-landslide samples.\n\nggplot(data=non_ls_data_20, aes(x= `Slope_Angle`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=40, color=\"black\", fill=\"#e9531e\") +\n  labs(title=\"Distribution of slope values in non-landslide samples (20° slope cut-off)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nAlthough the distribution for this stratified non-landslide sample is left-skewed, the data skewness has been reduced significantly. This indicates that our stratified sampling approach has helped to balance the distribution of the Slope_Angle feature in our dataset, which should lead to a more robust and reliable model."

However, it comes at the expense of having the lowest accuracy and sensitivity rates so far. As such, the overall performance was compromised after conducting stratified sampling. This suggests that while stratified sampling helped to balance the dataset, it may have introduced some bias that affected the model's predictive power. Further investigation and model tuning might be needed to improve the model's performance."

Therefore, we downsample our data to include only 20% of the initial data. We then split the data into training and testing sets. The initial_split function is used to ensure that the proportion of landslide data in both the training and testing sets is the same.\n\nls_data_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(data_20, coords = c(\"X\", \"Y\"))\nls_data_sf &lt;- st_set_crs(ls_data_sf, 32632) \nset.seed(1243)\n\nls_split &lt;- ls_data_sf %&gt;%\n  initial_split(prop = .2, \n                strata = Landslide)\n\ntraining_data_sf &lt;- training(ls_split)\ntesting_data_sf  &lt;- testing(ls_split)\n\ntraining_data_sp &lt;- as_Spatial(training_data_sf)\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Calculating Distance Matrix\nNext, we calculate a distance matrix.

The bandwidth is a crucial parameter in GWLR models as it determines the extent of the geographical area that influences the prediction at each location. Bandwidth can be either fixed or adaptive. data as we see in the figure. In adaptive weighting scheme, the weight kernels have larger bandwidths where the data are sparse and have smaller bandwidths where the data are plentiful.​\n\n\n\n\n\nWith fixed method, there is greater likelihood that some local calibrations will be based on only a few data points and so the resulting distribution of local esitmates will exhibit greater variation. We can reduce such estimation bias with adaptive approach.\n\nbw.adaptive &lt;- bw.ggwr(formula = \n                       Landslide ~ Slope_Angle, \n                       family = \"binomial\", \n                       data = training_data_sp, \n                       approach=\"CV\", \n                       kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                       adaptive= TRUE, \n                       longlat=FALSE, \n                       p=2,\n                       theta=0,\n                       dMat=distMAT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe computation of the adaptive bandwidth is a computationally intensive step. The resulting adaptive bandwidth value is 76. This means that the model considers the 76 closest data points when making a prediction at each location. This value was chosen to balance the trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency."

This indicates that the GWLR model explains the variability of the response data around its mean better than the generalized LR model.\nAt the same time, there was an observable improvement in the AIC when using the GWLR model. A lower AIC suggests a better model fit, so this is a positive outcome.\nIn global LR model, only singular estimate coefficients were generated for each explanatory variable. This means that each predictor has a fixed effect that does not vary across different geographical locations.\nOn the other hand, the local GWLR model generated a range of coefficient estimates for each explanatory variable, including the minimum, maximum, and median values. This suggests that the effect of the predictors in the GWLR model varies across different geographical locations, which can provide more nuanced insights into the data.\n\n\n\ngwlr_result &lt;- st_as_sf(gwlr$SDF) %&gt;% st_set_crs(32632)\ngwlr_result &lt;- subset(gwlr_result, select = c(yhat, geometry))"

    "text": "8.4 Variogram\nA variogram is a tool used in geostatistics to quantify the spatial autocorrelation of a variable. It provides a visual depiction of the covariance exhibited between each pair of points in the sampled data. For each pair of points in the sampled data, the “semivariance” is plotted against the distance between the pairs.\nThe variogram function from the gstat package in R is used to calculate the empirical variogram of the data. The fit.variogram function is then used to fit a theoretical variogram model to this empirical variogram. The vgm function is used to specify the theoretical variogram model to fit.\nThe psill parameter is the maximum semivariance value, also known as the sill. The model parameter specifies the type of variogram model to use, in this case, a spherical model. The range parameter is the distance at which the semivariance reaches the specified sill. The nugget parameter represents the variance at zero distance, accounting for measurement errors or spatial sources of variation at distances smaller than the sampling interval.\nSpherical variogram models are commonly used in geostatistical applications as they often have a similar shape to empirical variograms.\nHere is the code chunk that accomplishes this:\n\nv &lt;- variogram(yhat ~ 1, \n               data = gwlr_result)\nplot(v)\n\n\n\n\n\nfv &lt;- fit.variogram(object = v,\n                    model = vgm(\n                      psill = 0.5, \n                      model = \"Sph\",\n                      range = 5000, \n                      nugget = 0.1))\nfv\n\n  model      psill    range\n1   Nug 0.07203166    0.000\n2   Sph 0.05253883 8902.934\n\n\n\nplot(v, fv)"
