#### Introduction {style="color: #603494;"}
:::

Landslides, the failure and mass movement of slopes, have increased tenfold over the past five decades. Driven by tectonic, climatic, and human activities, they pose significant threats to infrastructure and urban communities, causing costly damage and displacement. While engineering solutions like concrete surfacing and terracing mitigate risks on gradual slopes, steeper terrains require more complex and expensive interventions. Implementing landslide susceptibility maps can aid urban planning by prioritizing high-risk areas, guiding preventive measures, and assessing site suitability for new developments.

As a result, landslide susceptibility modeling has emerged as a timely and crucial area of research. In this field, geoscientists and researchers strive to model landslide occurrences as a dynamic function of various predisposing and conditioning factors. Several qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches have been explored and proposed to establish the causal link between landslide factors and landslide susceptibility. Methodologically, many studies have explored different statistical and machine learning methods. Despite their usefulness, these methods often fail to explicitly consider the impact of **spatial non-stationarity** and **spatial autocorrelation** when geographically referenced data are used, thereby limiting their interpretability and practice applicability.

In this project, presented by **Khant Min Naing** and **Victoria Grace Ann** from *Singapore Management University*, we explore the potential of integrating spatial properties into generalised statistical and machine learning based landslide models. Using Valtellina Valley in Italy as a case study, this study developed and trained three spatial landslide models, **Geographically Weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR)**, **Moran's Eigenvector Random Forest (MERF)** and **Geographically Weighted Random Forest (GWRF)** and proposes an I**ntegrated Dual Geographical Random Forest Framework (Dual GRF)** leveraging on MERF and GWRF. The findings demonstrate that spatial models outperform global baseline models and result in more spatially-adaptive landslide risk predictions and interpretations.
