# What's up in Hanoi?

We made it to our first ever research conference!

From 1 to 4 July 2024, the International Conference on Computer Science and Its Applications held its 24th session at Thuyloi University. We received a very warm welcome to the conference venue and the volunteers were very approachable.

It was wonderful learning from many talented, inspiring and hardworking researchers, and how they have been developing models, conducting feasibility studies and applying computer science to address a diverse range of issues unique to their hometowns and beyond. We are also proud to announce that our paper is among the **39% of selected papers** for this conference proceeding and would like to thank our anonymous reviewers for their valuable input when we were drafting the final version of our paper.

On Day 1, 1 July 2024, we were very pumped and excited to share our findings from our explanatory model with fellow researchers. It was a great success and joy exchanging information and sharing about the power of using local models to devise a landslide susceptibility map!

Our research advisor Prof Kam Tin Seong was unable to join us for this conference this time, but we are immensely grateful for his encouragement and support.

Titled, "Is there a Space in Landslide Suceptibility Modelling: A Case Study of Valtellina Valley, Northern Italy", our published paper abstract can be found on Springer's website over [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-64605-8_16). Many thanks to the ICCSA conference organisers, chairs and sponsors for making ICCSA 2024 a success!
