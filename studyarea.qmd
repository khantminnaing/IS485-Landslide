**Valtellina Valley, Lombardy Region, Italy**

Valtellina or the Valtelline is a valley in the Lombardy region of northern Italy. The most important comune of the valley is Sondrio; the others major centers are Aprica, Morbegno, Tirano, Chiavenna, Bormio and Livigno.

Nestled between Switzerland and the Lombard plain, the valley's geographical setting plays a crucial role in its susceptibility to landslides, making it an ideal case study for understanding and mitigating these complex natural hazards.

**Geographic Features:**

-   **Alpine Setting:** Situated within the collision zone of the European and African plates, the Valtellina Valley experiences ongoing tectonic activity, leading to steep slopes, unstable rock formations, and frequent seismic tremors.

-   **Glacial Legacy:** Past glacial activity sculpted the valley's topography, resulting in U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, and over-steepened slopes, all contributing to potential landslide initiation zones.

-   **Hydrological Regimen:** The Adda River, fed by abundant alpine meltwater and subject to intense seasonal precipitation, carves into the valley floor, further weakening slopes and contributing to soil saturation, a key trigger for landslides.

-   **Densely Populated:** Despite its rugged terrain, the Valtellina Valley boasts a thriving population, with numerous villages and towns nestled along its slopes and valley floor. This proximity to potential landslides heightens the vulnerability of people and infrastructure.

Quantitative geomorphological and [environmental analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/environmental-analysis "Learn more about environmental analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") requires the adoption of well--defined spatial domains as basic mapping units. They provide local boundaries to aggregate environmental and morphometric variables and to perform calculations, thus they identify the spatial scale of the analysis. Grid cells, typically aligned with a [digital elevation model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/digital-elevation-model "Learn more about digital elevation model from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), are the standard mapping unit choice. A wiser choice is represented by slope units, irregular terrain partitions delimited by drainage and divide lines that maximise geomorphological homogeneity within each unit and geomorphological heterogeneity between neighbouring units. Adoption of slope units has the advantage of enforcing a strong relation with the underlying topography, absent in grid cell--based analyses.
